    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Brenden Wesley Jacobs, an experienced Electrical Design Manager and Designer based in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. With a National Diploma in Electrical Engineering from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and extensive experience in both technical and managerial roles, I bring a comprehensive skill set to every project I undertake.</p>
    <p>My professional journey started as an Electrical Technician at S4 Integration, where I honed my skills in basic electrical design, system installation, and client support. I quickly progressed to the role of Electrical Designer, taking on responsibilities that include providing detailed diagrams and designs, technical assistance, and collaborating closely with engineers to solve complex problems.</p>
    <p>I am proficient in EPLAN Electric P8, C, and Visual Basic programming, and I excel at electrical panel building and fault finding. My expertise extends to all areas of Microsoft Office, making me well-equipped to handle both the technical and administrative aspects of electrical design projects.</p>
    <p>Beyond my professional life, I have a passion for technology, gaming, movies, and travel. Although I don't get to travel as often as I'd like, I enjoy exploring new places and cultures whenever I can. I am dedicated to continuous improvement, both in my work efficiency and in leading a healthy, balanced lifestyle.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me for any electrical design projects or collaborations. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges!</p>
